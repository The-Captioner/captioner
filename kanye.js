    "I know you're happy, 'cause I can see it,so tell the voice inside your head to believe it","Woke up an optimist, sun was shining, I'm positive ","You know what the Midwest is? Young & restless. ","But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph ","And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today","Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky "," Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly "," I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven ","You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything, there'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream. There'll always be haters, that's the way it is ","For ever ever? For ever ever? Ever ever? ",
    "Let's go on a livin' spree. Shit, they say the best things in life are free ","Welcome to the good life","Everything I'm not, made me everything I am ","Let's have a toast for the douchebags. Let's have a toast for the assholes. Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know","On a bathroom wall I wrote, 'I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else'","Things used to be, now they not. Anything but us is who we are","Lost in this plastic life. Let's break out of this fake ass party ","I'm trying to right my wrongs, but it's funny, them same wrongs helped me write this song"," And don't let nobody with the power to sign ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme ","The weather's so breezy, man; why can life always be this easy?

"," I know I look better in real life ","In the club, always the flyest ","Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it. I guess every superhero need his theme music","I go for mine, I got to shine, now throw your hands up in the sky ","You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it ","Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low ",
    "It's amazing, I'm the reason everybody fired up this evening ","You got a new friend, well, I got homies ","Throw your hands up in the sky and say 'We don't care what people say' "," I'll never be picture perfect Beyonce ","Keep risin' 'til the sky knows your name","Nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe, it hurts, but it may be the only way ","I'll never be as laid back as this beat was ","They say that people in your life are seasons, and everything that happens is for a reason","She Instagram herself like 'Bad bitch alert.' He Instagram his watch like 'Mad rich alert' ","The good outweighs the bad even on your worst day"
