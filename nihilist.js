    "I guess broken pieces of glass hurt one badly and so does broken pieces of human heart. ","The worst part is time leaves forever but the pain it causes stays forever. ","Sometimes, you keep on waiting for that perfect day when everything is actually going to be ‘OKAY'. ","It's hard to understand that being us is the past now. ","World's may say that it's over but somewhere in the heart, a feeling called love was still there. ","His heart became too fragile and deprived of happiness. I think that heart was thirsty and the thirst was of love. ","It's like when you've been through a pile of minute problems then even a firey volcano of a huge one doesn't affects you much. ","At the end, it's not the people you miss. You miss the memories. ","There's someone who has been lost, the one I loved the most, And the one is you. ","The person who cried like hell when my eyes dropped tears has changed a lot. ",
    "I wish I could puke out all the pain that makes me feel a little weak, a little lonely and a little depressed. ","Not every person who asks about your problems is concerned about you. ","A crumbled piece of paper cannot be fixed to become a fine one and so does a broken relationship. ","Whenever I feel that things are going the right direction, they take a U-turn. ","Past is something that you can't let go. ","Now watching another dream feels like inviting another pain. ","It's better to break up when the sweet love turns into poison. ","Even though you were standing besides me, you were never there for me. ","If your love dies with the passage of time then it was never love. ","I tried my best to give this relationship the best I could but I guess destiny had some other plans.","I wanted our love to be like wine so that it could get better with time but it turned out to be a poison.

    "I tried my best to give this relationship the best I could but I guess destiny had some other plans.","I wanted our love to be like wine so that it could get better with time but it turned out to be a poison. ","Seen messages but no replies were the reason she cried at night. ","You cannot make someone love you. All you can do is love a person as much as you can.","Two broken hearts could together make a complete heart. ","Never ending talks ended with just one confrontation. ","One broken relationships makes you question every relationship. ","All I wanted was your love. I guess I asked for something too expensive. ","Before hurting some, just think about how would you feel if you were on there place? ","Her love abandoned her and then she abandoned love. ","She was innocent enough so she couldn't identify whether it was his love or just another game. ", 
    "She was innocent enough so she couldn't identify whether it was his love or just another game. ","It's not like I like being alone but it is that I've learnt to walk alone. ","My eyes shed tears every time I passed through the streets we walked together. ","You simply broke my trust in true love. ","I wish one could understand that not everything we say is a lie. ","I wish only if we could last a little longer. ","I dreamt of a forever but I guess he had a different view. ","I loved and I loved and I lost you. ","It's not like I don't want him to come back but I won't let him come. Cause deep down I fear that he would leave like he left before. ","Love isn't easy that's why only those who are capable to tackle it, get it. ","Loneliness turned his heart into a monster. ",
    "He cried every night and wake up like nothing bad ever happened. ","He proved that promises are made to be broken. ","With every tear her eyes dropped, she started hating even the feeling of love. ","He believed in love but the fear of heart break stopped him from confronting his feelings. ","Nothing ever could undo the pain you caused to me. ","You will always owe me a reason to not to believe in love. ","It was strange that amidst jealousy and fights our love lost somewhere.

","Without you, everything is still the same except me. ", 
    "Without you, everything is still the same except me. ","I didn't know what devastation meant until you left me. ","I don't know why I keep on believing that this ‘bad you' isn't not actually you, but it's just a mask that has pain and fear behind. ","Life seems without you. ","We are separated by distances not by hearts. ","I can't stop loving you even after eternity. ","Taken ",". Taken for granted. ","Just to avoid getting hurt, he started living alone.

","I wish I could undo all the things that broke us. ","Every ‘I am okay' actually means ‘I am totally broken. ","I am tired of trusting, loving, believing, getting hurt and of everything. I am just tired. ","Somewhere in my heart, I have a hope that everything would be fine one day. ","Sorry is never good enough. ","It's hard to forget and I regret all my mistakes.
